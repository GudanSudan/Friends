<h1 align=center>My Friends</h1>
<p>Hi! everybody. Hoping that you all will be fine and spending your time peacefully with your family. Welcoming you again to my little world. You all know very much about me. Today I shall tell you all about my kuttey and kamina friends. The two things that valued the most for me are my family and my friends. I have many friends but amongst them some are very special for me. Let me tell you all their names: Bhagyashree, Sonali, Afifa, Astha, Subhalaxmi, Janmejaya, Soumyajit, Abhijit, Samrriddh, Rudra, Rudra(Ratan) & Yashobant. Each of them is made up of one special type of habit means not good but bad very bad. Don't take it seriously. Just joking!</p>

<p>Let me introduce you to Sonali & Bhagyashree. Both of them are equally important for me. Both of them are equally loving and caring. Sonali is composed of a little bit of non-sense whereas Bhagyashree a bit of madness.Me and Sonali always fight with each other but can't leave without each other for one second also. She always irritate me but as she is my crime partner I always forget what she does. Bhagyashree is my bhabhi ji. She is a good singer but we always tease her that her voice is like a broken guitar's sound. Leave it! If I startend telling you everything about their deeds the words will finish soon.</p>

<p>Coming to the topic of Astha and Afifa. Kya hi kehna in dono ke baare mein! I mean to say that how can I tell you all about their kalakriti??They are so good that I can't describe them in my own words. Afifa is our Manjulika. She wants to ignore all of us for one day! But this mission is always impossible. You know why?? Because, we are so good na we didn't let this happen. Astha is my dewar ji and our selfie queen. She is the bestie of our Bho-Bho bhai means Soumyajit.</p>

<p> Let me introduce to my beloved husband Subhalaxmi a.k.a Chapati. I mean to say that she is my husband like friend. She is so pagal but I love her bubbly nature. She is our class monitor and we both are of the same house i.e.,Sankalp(Red) house. She is a good sportsperson and leader also. But the thing I always want to do to her is that I always want to irritate her. So now it's enough about the girls group.</p>

<p> Now let's move towars our sanskari group. Arey! can't understand our Boys group. I am known as sanskari bhai or sanskari by them. There is a long story behind this incident and I will tellyou all that story one day. Oh! let's begin with our first pair who is popularly known as Jama & Chitragupta. They are non other than Janmejaya & Soumyjit. They are my mad brothers. They are so good and so shy that anyone can do anything to them. Anything means anything! They are so introvert that anyone can take advantage of them. Soumyajit a.k.a Bho-Bho bhai is the bestie of Astha as you know and Janmejaya a.k.a Mew-Mew bhai is the ex-bestie of our beloved Priti bhabhi. They have broken all ties with each other now and Janmejaya is leading a single life with Samrriddh. Both of them are alo good in sports and Janmejaya is the vice-monitor of the boys of our class. He is also good in Maths & Physics also. Soumyajit is also good in Rangoli making and Sanskrit. Now leave it! Enough about these two animals.</p>

<p>Now let's move to our next jodi. Before getting started about I shall aware something about both of them. Always talk carefully in front of them because they are so good and sanskari na they can take anything in double-meaning. So, this double-minded jodi is none other than Abhijit & Samrriddh. They are so much double-minded that I can't describe how much double-minded they are. They have changed my name to Sudu-Sudu and moreover Abhijit, Rudra and Janmejaya call me aunty as I have let Sonali sit on me one day as there was no seat for her in our vehicle. Abhijit is multi-talented. He can do everything perfectly except studies. He is good in singing, dancing, drawing, games and cooking also. Samrriddh is good in playing football and also in doing some Math sums. Both of them are very naughty and good also! Now it is enough about these two double-minded personalities.</p>

<p>Now let me introduce you all to our next pair. They only have the same name and nothing same can be seen between both of them. They are none other than Rudra & Rudra. Rudra Manthan a.k.a Python is very much double-minded whereas Rudra Sethi a.k.a Ratan is a little bit double-minded. Both of them are very funny. They are also good in sports. Ratan is the dear husband of our Ratani a.k.a Bhagyashree. Python has given the name Sanskari Bhai to me. Now this is all enough about these mentals.</p>

<p>Now let's move towards our last sanskari. He is none other than Yashobant. He is our SST topper. His knowledge always overflows. He doesn't know what he talks. He always talks anab-sanab. He is also good in playing football. He is also very good in doing Maths. Now all these are enough for him now and if I will now talk about all his deeds then no sooner these words will be finished.</p>

<p>Finally, my list ends here. Huh! I don't know wheather all of them are fond of me or not but all of them are very precious to me and will be an unforgottable part of my life. That's all. Bye!</p>
